# Tropical Paradise

A beautiful and useful color scheme made for terminal wizards. It makes all the
colors and its variants distinguishable with the HUE it is supposed to be,
without changes that can confuses you like many other color schemes do for the
sake of styling.

It is available for the applications and style languages I use most.

palette of the themes.
